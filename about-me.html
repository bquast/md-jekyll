	<p>With 8+ years of professional development experience, I'm using my well-founded knowledge as well as my neverending thirst to explore new to provide consulting and programming services for online content publishers.</p>
	<p>I love writing code and enjoy working - more or less fluently - with PHP, Python, CSS (2/3), HTML(4/5)/XHTML, JavaScript and a bit of Java.</p>
	<p>I love writing code, APIs, Android, Open Source, Search, Web Semantics and related stuff.</p>
	<p>In my (rare) free time i love spending time with my wife and my tomcat Bexton.</p>
	<p>More to come..</p>
